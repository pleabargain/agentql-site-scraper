This script automates the login process for the target site portal using Playwright and AgentQL.

So far, I have only tested it on the My Target Site portal with middling success.

You'll need an agentQL API key to use this script.

I have set it up so that you can use the same script for multiple sites by changing the .env file. YMMV!
